# MapReduce Tasks: Enhanced Non-Functional Requirements 🗺️

The development of MapReduce tasks within a distributed system necessitates a comprehensive set of non-functional requirements. These are pivotal for ensuring the system's functionality, robustness, and user accessibility.

## Enhanced System Performance and Efficiency 🚀
- Enable horizontal scaling to support system growth without performance degradation.
- Aim for high data throughput and low processing latency, targeting processing speeds of 1TB per hour on the highest possible allocation with network overhead under 10% of total computational time.
- Optimize resource allocation for at least 75% utilization rate by project's end.
- Implement resource allocation policies per user and platform for cost-effective operation and optimization.

## Improved Reliability and Availability 🛡️
- Guarantee job completion despite failures in hardware, software, or network, with a 75% job completion rate on first release, increasing to 99% by project end.
- Strive for 90% or higher system uptime, and develop a monitoring tool in tandem with the core library after its initial release.

## Enhanced Maintainability and Modularity 🧩
- Facilitate system updates and maintenance with a maximum downtime of 4 hours.
- Architect the system for modular updates, affecting no more than 15% of the system at any time, and reassess this modularity with each major update.

## Advanced Fault Tolerance and Data Integrity 🔍
- Ensure system recovery from node failures within 5 minutes, with minimal progress loss.
- Target a data corruption rate under 0.01%, utilizing effective error detection and correction mechanisms.

## Improved User Experience and Interaction 👥
- Aim for a user first-time setup duration of under 6 hours for typical users.
- Provide comprehensive, clear, and regularly updated documentation for new developer and administrator onboarding.
- Offer practical demonstrations for navigating core functionalities, emphasizing system efficiency.
- Use reliable authentication tools for secure user authentication and personal data protection.
- Facilitate user access moderation by admins through an intuitive graphical interface.

## System Flexibility Enhancements 🌐
- Guarantee compatibility with various data sources and systems, supporting multiple file formats.
- Implement advanced load balancing to prevent node overloads, continuously refining load distribution strategies.

## Upgraded Monitoring and Logging 📊
- Deploy real-time system monitoring with a commitment to 100% job logging.
