# Testing paradigms

Our project implements two testing paradigms: <code>unit testing</code> and <code>end-to-end testing</code>.

## Unit testing
- The Koala side of our project has unit tests in the <code>test</code> directroy. These unit tests also run in the CI pipeline, when building the Koala docker image
- The Eucalypt side of our project has unit tests in the <code>eucalypt/node-api/\_\_tests\_\_</code> directory

## End-to-end testing
- Verifies that the infrastructure can be brought up correctly
- Simulates *a plethora* of workloads on the infrastructure:
    - Runs all code samples (sample.cpp, word_counter.cpp, real_estate.cpp, genomic_sample.cpp)
    - Verifies their output against output collected from correct, single-threaded Python solutions
    - Runs the samples in multiple cluster configurations:
        - Different cluster sizes (testsing lower/higher contention on the Master node)
        - Worker failure percentage (testing the fault tolerance aspects of the infrastructure)
    - Runs the samples in multiple user modes:
        - Guest (no job token)
        - User (job tokens generated by Eucalypt)
    - Logs generated by the different processes are checkes so as to confirm normal service interactions
