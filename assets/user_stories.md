## User (can access cluster resources, as he/she has an account created by the administrator)
- As a user, I want to create a map-reduce job and submit it for computation *on the cluster* so that I can efficiently process large amounts of data.
- As a user, I want to configure I/O parameters for map-reduce jobs, namely the number of input and output files, so that I have control over the size of the generated files.
- As a user, I want to monitor ongoing jobs created by me so that I can track their progress and view utilization statistics.
- As a user, I want to set up recurring or scheduled map-reduce jobs so that they can execute without manual triggering.

        - Then: The user is banned and a message is displayed to the administrator.
- As an admin, I want to accept user account creation requests so that new users can access the resources of the cluster.
- As an admin, I want to monitor all ongoing jobs and utilization metrics so that I can assess the performance and cost of the cluster.
- As an admin, I want to be able to promote a user to admin status so that I can delegate administrative responsibilities.

## Network Administrator
- As a network administrator, I want to be able to set up this infrastructure on my Kubernetes cluster, so that my organization can benefit from the parallelization features provided.
