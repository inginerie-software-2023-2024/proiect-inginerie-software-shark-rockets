# Builds the docker image for eucalypt backend.
# It temporarily copies the proto that the backend needs in order to talk to the master.
# Ugly as it might look, I've chosen this for three reasons:
#   - Docker does not do symbolic links
#   - Docker can only operate with files in its build context (which is the current folder)
#   - If I were to place this Dockerfile in the root of the project, the .dockerignore gets in the way, as it ignores eucalypt/

docker build . -t eucalypt_backend:0.0.1
